# Docklet – DevOps CI/CD Platform for Mobile Apps

**Build, Test, Release mobile apps — faster, safer, and 100% reproducible using containerized CI environments.**

## Why Docklet?

Most mobile CI/CD tools (like Jenkins, Bitrise, or GitHub Actions) are often hard to configure, lack portability, and become expensive at scale. Docklet solves core mobile CI challenges:

- Emulator inconsistencies
- iOS/macOS dependency hell
- App signing issues
- Flaky build debugging

Docklet containerizes every part of the mobile development lifecycle — from build to release — using Docker-powered, reproducible environments.

## Core Features

### 1. Dockerized Mobile Build Runtimes
- Prebuilt Docker images for Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, and Kotlin Multiplatform
- `docklet init` bootstraps a reproducible container for your stack

### 2. One-Click Emulator Testing
- Run Android emulators inside Docker (with nested KVM support)
- Remote iOS testing via macOS runners or MacStadium
- Auto-screenshots and video logs for each test run

### 3. Secure App Signing Vault
- Securely manage keystores, certs, and provisioning profiles using Vault or SOPS
- Credentials are injected at build time — never stored or hardcoded
- Web UI to rotate/revoke signing credentials

### 4. Instant Rollbacks & Build Snapshots
- Create snapshot states of your builds
- Rollback releases or re-test older builds effortlessly  
```bash
docklet snapshot create -m "before v2.1 release"
```

### 5. Matrix Testing & Smart Parallelism
- Test across screen sizes, OS versions, and devices in parallel containers
- Auto-selects device matrix using failure history

### 6. Smart Build Optimizer
- Caches Gradle, CocoaPods, npm, etc. between builds
- Analyzes code changes to skip redundant build steps

### 7. Cloud + On-Prem Deployment
- Run locally or in Kubernetes clusters
- Integrates with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or use standalone

### 8. App Store Integrations
- Push APKs/IPAs to Play Store or TestFlight directly
- View status, release notes, and uploaded versions in the Web UI

### 9. Dev Preview Links
- Auto-generate install links via Firebase App Distribution, Expo, or Diawi
- Share with QA/PMs via Slack, Email, or WhatsApp

### 10. AI-Powered Build Failure Analysis
- Uses LLMs + log parsers to auto-summarize build errors
- Suggests actionable fixes based on error patterns  
Example:  
> “Build failed due to missing SDK 33. Suggested fix: Update `compileSdkVersion` to 33 in `build.gradle`.”

### 11. Team Dashboard
- Visualize builds, tests, and deployment history
- Assign roles like Developer, QA, or Release Manager
- Track failure trends by PR, module, or contributor

### 12. End-to-End CI/CD YAML Configuration  
Define and version your pipeline easily:
```yaml
docklet-pipeline:
  platform: android
  steps:
    - run: ./gradlew assembleRelease
    - test: ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
    - sign:
        keystore: encrypted-keystore.jks
        alias: appRelease
    - distribute:
        service: firebase
        testers: qa-team@company.com
```

## Innovative Edge

### Prebuilt Emulator Farms  
- Rent emulator time on Docklet Cloud  
- One-click launch from dashboard with real-time logs and media

### Dynamic Secrets Injection  
- Secrets are injected directly into container memory  
- Auto-destroyed post-build, never written to disk

### Offline Build Containers  
- Fully offline development possible  
- All tools pre-baked into Docker images — great for remote setups

### Portable CI  
- Run the same CI pipeline locally using:
```bash
docklet run
```
- Debug failed builds without pushing to CI

### Code-to-Deploy Bot  
- Trigger Docklet pipelines from PR comments:
```bash
/docklet deploy android to beta
```

## Tech Stack

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python/Go CLI Daemon
- React or Svelte for Web UI
- Vault / SOPS for secret management
- Firebase App Distribution, Google Play API, TestFlight CLI
- QEMU/KVM for virtualization
- LLM API (OpenAI/local) for log parsing
